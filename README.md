-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hoda!
I'm a PhD candidate researching Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a focus on improving sample efficiency using techniques like Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) and Self-Imitation Learning (SIL).

    ðŸ‘€ Research Interests: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning, especially in the context of sample-efficient algorithms for complex, high-dimensional environments.
    ðŸŒ± Currently Working On: Advancing Reinforcement Learning using Pytorch, with an emphasis on algorithms that integrate experience replay, intrinsic rewards, and imitation learning to enhance performance in continuous control tasks.
    ðŸš€ Looking to Collaborate: I'm open to innovative startup projects that apply cutting-edge machine learning techniques in real-world problems, particularly in RL, AI-driven automation, and decision-making systems.
    ðŸ’¬ Feel Free to Ask Me About: Python programming, Machine Learning algorithms, Deep Learning frameworks, and anything related to Reinforcement Learning, including experience replay and policy optimization.
